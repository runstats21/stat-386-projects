# Why Use Statistics?
### A world full of data will end in either greater confusion or great direction, depending on how we used Statistics

Think of trying to summit a large mountain. Now think of all the data you will want before you begin your journey. You could go to the bottom of the mountain an collect data as you go, or you can used statistics to make your journey as easy as possible.

**How is this so?**

As in this example, there are statistics all around us that summarize the information we seek: The elevation of Mt. Rainier, the optimal path to reach the summit from your current location, and how many feet you will gain per mile on your given path, all are statistics that help to summarize your climb of this mountain.

> Collect data and compute meaningful statistics, and you can better summit all the mountains in your life <br>
