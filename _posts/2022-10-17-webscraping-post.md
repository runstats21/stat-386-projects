# College Scoreboard Data Collection

## Introduction

Documentation on the College Scorecard and associated API: [College Scorecard Documentation](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/)

*Complete code for this data collection can be found in [this GitHub repo]*(https://github.com/runstats21/college-score-card-analysis)


## Data Collection

### Tools

Using the [requests module](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) within Python, I was able to obtain valuable information on almost 2000 University's throughout the U.S. via the College Scoreboard government API. However, any resource that allows for API calls will work following a similar process, such as using R's [httr library](https://httr.r-lib.org/).




Another helpful GitHub repos for this analysis that helped me as I collected this data can be found [here](https://github.com/kiseki1107/College-Scorecard-Data-Analysis)


### Step 1: Optain API key

### Step 2: Prepare API key for GitHub
