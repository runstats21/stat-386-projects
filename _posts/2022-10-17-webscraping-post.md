# College Scoreboard Data Collection

## Introduction

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, college enrollment in the US has declined for [three years straight](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/10/20/college-enrollment-declines-since-pandemic/) (as reported by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/10/20/college-enrollment-declines-since-pandemic/)), even with access to information greater than ever before. For both parents and young adolescents, many factors contribute to the decision to enroll in college, and to which institution(s) to enroll.

*Complete code for this data collection can be found in [this GitHub repo]*(https://github.com/runstats21/college-score-card-analysis)


## Data Collection

### Tools

Using the [requests module](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) within Python, I was able to obtain valuable information on almost 2000 University's throughout the U.S. via the College Scoreboard government API. However, any resource that allows for API calls will work following a similar process, such as using R's [httr library](https://httr.r-lib.org/).




Another helpful GitHub repos for this analysis that helped me as I collected this data can be found [here](https://github.com/kiseki1107/College-Scorecard-Data-Analysis)


### Step 1: Optain API key

### Step 2: Prepare API key for GitHub

### Step 3: Identify required endpoint parameters

### Step 4: Gather data of interest

### Step 5: Data Cleaning of Percent variables
