## Introduction


For the full details on data collection, see my previous blog post [here](https://runstats21.github.io/stat-386-projects/2022/10/17/webscraping-post.html)

## Preliminary Relationships between Features of Interest
After brainstorming, I decided on the following 13 variables that were of most interest for performing EDA:
* School Name
* State
* School Ownership
* Full-time Faculty Rate (%)
* Faculty Average Salary
* Student Enrollment Size
* Retention Rate 4 Yr (%)
* Academic Cost
* Admission Rate (%)
* SAT Average (Overall)
* Mean Earnings (10 Yrs after Entry)
* Female_Majority indicator variable
* Mean Earnings Gender Difference (10 Yrs after Entry)

**Retention Rates by School Ownership**

* On average, Private For-Profit unversities seem to have a much lower retention-rate than Private Not-For-Profit universities and Public Universities
