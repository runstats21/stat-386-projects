## Introduction


For the full details on data collection, see my previous blog post [here](https://runstats21.github.io/stat-386-projects/2022/10/17/webscraping-post.html)

## Preliminary Relationships between Features of Interest
After brainstorming, I decided on the following 13 variables that were of most interest for performing EDA:
* School Name
* State
* School Ownership
* Full-time Faculty Rate (%)
* Faculty Average Salary
* Student Enrollment Size
* Retention Rate 4 Yr (%)
* Attendance Cost
* Admission Rate (%)
* SAT Average (Overall)
* Mean Earnings (10 Yrs after Entry)
* Female Majority indicator variable (`Female_Majority`)
* Mean Earnings Gender Difference (10 Yrs after Entry) (`MeanEarningsGenderDiff10`)


The following correlation matrix helps identify features of interest that are highly correlated:

Observing that there are several features of interest with significant correlations, I produced plots (using the [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) module) to explore these relationships further. I present several of these plots below with comments on the general trends presented by each of them.


## Key Relationships

The following graphics show key relationships presented by the latest *College Scoreboard* data:


**Faculty Average Salary and Mean Earnings (10 Years Post Entry)**

* As shown, there is a clear relationship between Faculty's Average Annual Salary and the Mean Earnings of students 10 years after entry
* Additionally, it seems this relationship is most clear for Private NonProfit Universities, of which this dataset has the most data



**Retention Rates by School Ownership**

* On average, Private For-Profit unversities seem to have a much lower retention-rate than Private Not-For-Profit universities and Public Universities

## Conclusion

It seems from this analysis that ...
